## Time Series Forecasting

In this lesson, time series forecasting is explained with various approaches in detail by the famous ML author **Aurélien Géron** who published many best selling books in ML concepts.

The concepts learnt so far are:
* Common Patterns - Trend, Seasonality, Noise
* Basic Forecasting approaches - Naive Forecating, Moving Average
* Time window preparation - in order to use for model creation and evaluation
* Forecasting with basic tensorflow models (linear and dense)
* Simple RNN - Sequential to Vector model, Sequential to Sequential model
* Stateful RNN - Includes sequential batches one after the other (not shuffled)
* LSTM - With stateful rnn architecture
